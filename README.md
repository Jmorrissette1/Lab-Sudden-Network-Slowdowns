# Lab-Sudden-Network-Slowdowns

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The **server team** reported **significant network performance degradation** on several older devices within the **10.0.0.0/16** network range.  
After ruling out any external Distributed Denial of Service (**DDoS**) attacks, the **security team** suspected that the cause might be **internal network activity**.

**Goal:**  
Investigate the root cause of the performance degradation and determine whether malicious or unauthorized internal activity â€” such as **network scanning** â€” was occurring.
